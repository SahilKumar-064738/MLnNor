"""Deterministic, conservative text normalization functions.

Every transformation here was validated against the actual seven attached
TSV files (see implementation.md Sections 2-3, 8-9) before being included.
Nothing here performs entity deduplication or matching.

Design notes (see implementation.md Section 26 "known issues to fix"):
  * Landmark detection is WORD-BOUNDARY aware (a substring like "near"
    inside "nearby" or "shearer" must never be treated as a landmark).
  * Legal-suffix and address-abbreviation mapping are TOKEN-boundary only
    (never a substring replace inside a longer word).
  * Bulk (DataFrame-column) functions are provided alongside the
    single-value functions so callers can avoid `df.apply(axis=1)` over
    millions of rows (Section 11). The single-value functions remain the
    source of truth and are exercised directly by the unit tests; the bulk
    functions are thin vectorized wrappers around the same logic.
